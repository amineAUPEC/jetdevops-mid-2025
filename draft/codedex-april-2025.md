In a five-star restaurant review system (⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️), the stars typically represent the different levels of satisfaction.

But what does each of the stars mean?

Start by creating a rating variable and set it equal to a decimal number.

Make a rating system using an if/elif/else statement:

rating greater than 4.5, print 'Extraordinary'
rating greater than 4, print 'Excellent'
rating greater than 3, print 'Good'
rating greater than 2, print 'Fair'
Everything else, print 'Poor'




### ... exercice 2 
# Write code below 💖

grade=int(input('Enter your grade as 0 to 20'))


if grade == 9:
  print('Freshman')
elif grade == 10: 
  print('Sophomore')
elif grade == 11: 
  print('Junior')
elif grade == 12: 
  print('Senior')
else: 
  print('TBD')
  

U.S. high schools typically last for four years, from freshman year to senior year. 🚌💨

First, ask the user to enter their grade as an integer.

Create a four-year high school grade system using an if/elif/else statement:

grade is 9, print 'Freshman'
grade is 10, print 'Sophomore'
grade is 11, print 'Junior'
grade is 12, print 'Senior'
Everything else is 'TBD'

elif snapple == 2: 
  print('Shrimp can only swim backwards.')
elif snapple == 3: 
  print('A taste bud\'s life span is about 10 days.')
elif snapple == 4: 
  print('It is impossible to sneeze while sleeping.')
elif snapple == 5: 
  print('It is illegal to sing off-key in North Carolina.')
